# EatCode - Your Coding Sheet Tracker

Welcome to EatCode, your go-to tool for keeping track of your progress in solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions from popular coding sheets. This project aims to make your coding journey smoother by providing you with a centralized platform to manage your practice questions effectively.

Motivation
The motivation behind the EatCode project is to assist developers and coding enthusiasts in their journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms. By presenting users with a curated collection of coding sheets and offering features like question tracking, filtering, and easy access to popular coding problems, we aim to make your coding practice more efficient and enjoyable.

Key Features
1. Display Popular Coding Sheets
EatCode provides you with a selection of popular coding sheets, making it easy to find a wide variety of practice questions. You can browse through these sheets to discover new challenges to tackle.

2. Question Tracking
Never lose track of your progress. If you're solving a question from one coding sheet and come across the same question in another sheet, EatCode will automatically mark it as completed. This feature helps you efficiently manage your coding practice.

3. Advanced Filters
EatCode offers a range of filters to help you find the questions that suit your needs:

Difficulty: Filter questions by their difficulty level, whether you're a beginner or an expert.
Topic: Focus on specific DSA topics, such as arrays, trees, or graphs.
Company Tags: Prepare for interviews with questions tagged by specific companies.
Average Time Taken: Sort questions based on the average time taken by other users to solve them.
